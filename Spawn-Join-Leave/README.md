A plugin that combines "Join message with config" with "Spawn" plugin.
- /setmessage join/leave
- /spawn (yourself or a player)
- /setspawn
- First joiners and respawning players appear at /spawn
- With proper permissions for all commands.
- Support for Minecraft color codes (&)

As of now, this plugin fails to get spawn location in config.yml on startup (After already establishing a location). I believe that the code for normal config and location-based config is slightly different, and cannot be put together. 

This plugin is currently discontinued until further notice.
